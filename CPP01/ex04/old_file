Hi, this is a story about Lulu. When Lulu was 15, Lulu moved to the UK with Lulu's family. 
When Lulu was 19, Lulu got accepted to Lulu's dream uni and Lulu started to study echonomics.
However, Lulu soon realised that she does not like the major Lulu chose at all, an after graduating and working in finance for 2 years, Lulu decided to follow her dream and study computer science...
Since then, Lulu has been very happy!
